# Colour Palette Analysis

- What are good palettes?
- Can I measure how good is it?
- How to ensure that my palette is safe for colour blind?
- Can I use AI generate an optimised colour palette?
- How to choose `figsize=(w, h)`, `dpi`, `linewidth`, `markersize`?

- I try to figure out the keywords: `hue-saturation-brightness, contrast`. (distribution in someone's visualisation styles)
